LICENSING NOTE: Recent versions of DexPatcher no longer require that
users bundle the DexPatcher annotations with every patch (although
continuing to do so has no ill effects). The DexPatcher licensing
terms no longer impose licensing restrictions on patches, as long as
users refrain from bundling the DexPatcher annotations with them.
In particular, DexPatcher patches are no longer considered to be
derivative works of DexPatcher and thus are no longer automatically
covered by the GPL. Legals aside, the DexPatcher project urges you
not to use copyright laws to introduce artificial scarcity in the
world. Please give back to the community: share your work.
